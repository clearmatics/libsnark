The sage script parameters.sage requires the official Anemoi SAGE
implementation from [1]. To run it, do the following steps;

1. execute git clone https://github.com/anemoi-hash/anemoi-hash.git

2. put the downloaded contents in the same directory as file
parameters.sage.

3. edit file anemoi.sage to replace "if __name__ == "__main__":" with
"def main():"

4. load parameters.sage in SAGE.

Tested with 'SageMath version 9.3, Release Date: 2021-05-09' on 8 Nov
2022.

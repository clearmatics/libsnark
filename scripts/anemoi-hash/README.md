# Anemoi: a Family of ZK-friendly AO Hash Functions

This repository contains a first implementation in sage of the **Anemoi** family of hash functions.
**Anemoi** is a family of Arithmetization Oriented Hash Functions that operates over prime and binary fields.

Our paper on Anemoi can be found on ePrint: https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/840.

## Contents
The sage script ```anemoi.sage``` contains various routines to evaluate **Anemoi** (including **AnemoiJive** and **AnemoiSponge**) but also to generate the corresponding systems of equations.

First some basics functions allow to provide well-chosen parameters: field, number of rounds, linear layer, ... for various instances of **Anemoi**.

The class ```AnemoiPermutation``` then contains different sections:
- Sub-components: ```evaluate_sbox``` and ```linear_layer``` respectively apply our **Flystel** construction and the linear layer.
- Evaluation: ```eval_with_intermediate_values``` performs an evaluation of **Anemoi** using the SPN construction. The function also return intermediate values as this can be used to check the solutions of the systems of equations generated.
- Writing full system of equations: ```get_polynomial_variables```, ```verification_polynomials``` and ```print_verification_polynomials``` allow to generate the corresponding multivariate system of polynomial equations. This indeed allowed us to perform our security analysis using Grobner basis attacks. 

The two functions ```jive``` and ```sponge_hash``` are routines to evaluate **AnemoiJive** and **AnemoiSponge** that respectively correspond to our Merkle Compression function, and our Hash function.
